# Ludo Multiplayer

A fast, modern, and highly polished Ludo game with Online Multiplayer and Local (Human vs AI) modes. Built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO on the backend and a custom-rendered board on the frontend. Comes with animated themes, sound, smart turn logic, and a slick lobby experience.

This game is now a fully functional Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed on mobile devices and played offline!
